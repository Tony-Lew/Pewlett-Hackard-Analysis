# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

### Overview 

  We teamed up with Bobby on this project working with SQL to try and get ahead of the “Silver tsunami”. We used the knowledge we gained to determine how many employees are coming of age to retire and who we can start mentoring now to replace them. We started with 6 different CSV files and with learning to use a diagram to create comprehensible ERDs we created many more. 

### Resources

  -	ERD = Entity Relationship Diagram. It is a visualization chart to show how we can combine different data tables by using primary keys or foreign keys. Primary and      foreign keys are what the data tables have in common to be able to combine data creating a new data set.
  -	Quickdbd = Quick Database Diagram is an online tool to help us map the ERDs so we can see what keys to use.
  -	PostgreSQL is a database system platform that uses the SQL language.
  -	pgAdmin is a web based graphic interface tool used to interact with the Postgres database platform.

### Overview of the analysis
   We investigated Pewlett-Hackards employees to find how many of the company’s employees could retire at any given time. We discovered 90,398 employees in
different varying positions could retire. With this knowledge we know that Pewlett-Hackard needed to prepare themselves for this scenario and start a mentorship 
program. We did a dive into employment records and focused on the year 1965 and found that in those parameters 1549 employees matched the criteria asked for to 
be in a mentoring position.



### Results
-	90,398 employees are eligible to retire at any time
-	64% of these employees are in Senior positions.
-	30% of these employees are in the position right under Senior
-	2% of the current staff are eligible for mentoring positions
-	We need to look at expanding the mentoring age range to fill these gaps
