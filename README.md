# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

### Overview 

We teamed up with Bobby on this project working with SQL to try and get ahead of the “Silver tsunami”. We used the knowledge we gained to determine how many employees are coming of age to retire and who we can start mentoring now to replace them. We started with 6 different CSV files and with learning to use a diagram to create comprehensible ERDs we created many more. 

### Resources

  -	ERD = Entity Relationship Diagram. It is a visualization chart to show how we can combine different data tables by using primary keys or foreign keys. Primary and      foreign keys are what the data tables have in common to be able to combine data creating a new data set.
  -	Quickdbd = Quick Database Diagram is an online tool to help us map the ERDs so we can see what keys to use.
  -	PostgreSQL is a database system platform that uses the SQL language.
  -	pgAdmin is a web based graphic interface tool used to interact with the Postgres database platform.
