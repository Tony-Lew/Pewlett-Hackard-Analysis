# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

### Overview :rocket:

We teamed up with Bobby on this project working with SQL to try and get ahead of the “Silver tsunami”. We used the knowledge we gained to determine how many employees are coming of age to retire and who we can start mentoring now to replace them. We started with 6 different CSV files and with learning to use a diagram to create comprehensible ERDs we created many more.
